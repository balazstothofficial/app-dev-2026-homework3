/**
 * # Homework 3 — Shop App
 *
 * Build a small shopping UI with ComposeUI using the **example data** from the
 * `tcs.app.dev.homework.data` package (items, prices, discounts, and ui resources).
 * The goal is to implement three tabs: **Shop**, **Discounts**, and **Cart**.
 *
 * ## Entry point
 *
 * The composable function [ShopScreen] is your entry point that holds the UI state
 * (selected tab and the current `Cart`).
 *
 * ## Data
 *
 * - Use the provided **example data** and data types from the `data` package:
 *   - `Shop`, `Item`, `ItemId`, `Discount`, `Cart`, and `Euro`.
 *   - There are useful resources in `res/drawable` and `res/values/strings.xml`.
 *     You can add additional ones.
 *     Do **not** hard-code strings in the UI!
 *
 * ## Requirements
 *
 * 1) **Shop item tab**
 *    - Show all items offered by the shop, each row displaying:
 *      - item image + name,
 *      - item price,
 *      - an *Add to cart* button.
 *    - Tapping *Add to cart* increases the count of that item in the cart by 1.
 *
 * 2) **Discount tab**
 *    - Show all available discounts with:
 *      - an icon + text describing the discount,
 *      - an *Add to cart* button.
 *    - **Constraint:** each discount can be added **at most once**.
 *      Disable the button (or ignore clicks) for discounts already in the cart.
 *
 * 3) **Cart tab**
 *    - Only show the **Cart** tab contents if the cart is **not empty**. Within the cart:
 *      - List each cart item with:
 *        - image + name,
 *        - per-row total (`price * amount`),
 *        - an amount selector to **increase/decrease** the quantity (min 0, sensible max like 99).
 *      - Show all selected discounts with a way to **remove** them from the cart.
 *      - At the bottom, show:
 *        - the **total price** of the cart (items minus discounts),
 *        - a **Pay** button that is enabled only when there is at least one item in the cart.
 *      - When **Pay** is pressed, **simulate payment** by clearing the cart and returning to the
 *        **Shop** tab.
 *
 * ## Navigation
 * - **Top bar**:
 *      - Title shows either the shop name or "Cart".
 *      - When not in Cart, show a cart icon.
 *        If you feel fancy you can add a badge to the icon showing the total count (capped e.g. at "99+").
 *      - The cart button is enabled only if the cart contains items. In the Cart screen, show a back
 *        button to return to the shop.
 *
 * - **Bottom bar**:
*       - In Shop/Discounts, show a 2-tab bottom bar to switch between **Shop** and **Discounts**.
*       - In Cart, hide the tab bar and instead show the cart bottom bar with the total and **Pay**
*         action as described above.
 *
 * ## Hints
 * - Keep your cart as a single source of truth and derive counts/price from it.
 *   Rendering each list can be done with a `LazyColumn` and stable keys (`item.id`, discount identity).
 * - Provide small reusable row components for items, cart rows, and discount rows.
 *   This keeps the screen implementation compact.
 *
 * ## Bonus (optional)
 * Make the app feel polished with simple animations, such as:
 * - `AnimatedVisibility` for showing/hiding the cart,
 * - `animateContentSize()` on rows when amounts change,
 * - transitions when switching tabs or updating the cart badge.
 *
 * These can help if want you make the app feel polished:
 * - [NavigationBar](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/components/navigation-bar)
 * - [Card](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/components/card)
 * - [Swipe to dismiss](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/touch-input/user-interactions/swipe-to-dismiss)
 * - [App bars](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/components/app-bars#top-bar)
 * - [Pager](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts/pager)
